In this project, I used MVC architecture to create a web program that would serve as a movie review site. By using Java classes, Java servlets,
jsp pages for views, and a MySql database accessed by a Java JDBC page, my program could create a session for each user (either existing or new),
and allow that user to create unique reviews for movies that were either existing or added by the user, and store the information in a mysql database. I gave each movie info and review unique id's
that could be attached to each user, then the review scores were aggregated among all users and shown as the new average score. It was quite a large project,
and so I will group all the pages in seperate folders so as to keep things easily organized and viewable. The server I was using for the JDBC page is no longer
active, but I will leave the code for the page, as well as screenshots and videos of the output and the working program.
